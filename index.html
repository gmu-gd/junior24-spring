      <h2>delivery and timing</h2>
      <p>We will meet in person once a week on Thursdays from 4:30 to 7:10 in AB 2044. The classes are required and during our sessions we will discuss work, complete assignments, and further our art and design knowledge. The class is scheduled for 15 weeks and you can expect to work for 6 hours outside of class each week.</p>
      <h2>prerequisites</h2>
      <p>AVT 180: New Media in the Creative Arts, AVT 110: Digital Design Studio, or permission of instructor.</p>
      <h2>course description</h2>
      <p>An inter-media, project-driven course focused on the role of research in artistic conceptual development and the artmaking process. In this course, you’ll have a chance to explore various modes of research, including archival and scholarly research, gathering and creation of primary source data through surveys, interview, or haptic/tactile experience of place, and nontraditional or experimental research through the use of various prompts. Using your own mode of inquiry, you’ll research and develop an individual work that you’ll also document and describe for a collaborative publication and show in the final third of the term. With your junior cohort, you’ll attend the Spring series of Visual Voices lectures, and read and discuss shared texts.</p>
      <h2>objectives</h2>
      <ul class="arrow">
        <li>Students will employ <strong>critical thinking</strong> through the analysis of their own and/or other’s practices.</li>
        <li>Students will articulate the <strong>context</strong> of their work.</li>
        <li>Students will demonstrate <strong>skills</strong> essential to their practice.</li>
        <li>Students will engage in <strong>research</strong> strategies through exploration, evaluation, and/or synthesis.</li>
        <li>Students will integrate <strong>conceptual frameworks</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>the machine</h2>
      <p>David Dewane, an architecture professor, designed a space, a building, meant to encourage Deep Work for its inhabitants. This structure was called a Eudaimonia Machine. “The goal of the machine,” David explains, “is to create a setting where the users can get into a state of deep human flourishing - creating work that’s at the absolute extent of their personal abilities.”  (Cal Newport’s Deep Work)  We will be framing the semester with a discussion on the Eudaimonia Machine employing this fictional piece of architecture to help us structure time.</p>
      <h2>projects</h2>

      <h2>field trip schedule</h2>
      <ul class="arrow">
        <li><strong>February 9 at 11:45am</strong> National Museum of African American History and Culture</li>
        <li><strong>March 22 at 1pm</strong> Renwick Gallery and Hirshorn Museum</li>
        <li><strong>April 5 at 11am</strong> National Museum of Women in the Arts</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>discussion of work</h2>
      <p>You will need to take an active role in both the presentation and discussion of your work. We will review projects in a variety of ways and you are expected to be able to talk and write about your own work and give feedback to your peers about their work. The ability to discuss your work and other student’s work is a very important part of your education at Mason. Use this class to improve on those skills.</p>
      <h2>communication</h2>
      <p>Your ability to communicate with me is of prime importance in this course. If you are going to be absent, late, or not have your work, it will be your best interest in communicating those things to me in advance. I do not need to know your reasons for being absent, late, or not having your work but I do need to know.</p>
      <p>A simple, short email will be fine.</p>
      <p>The same goes for if you are struggling in this class or having other issues that are hindering your ability to complete work in this class. The more you keep me in the loop the more I can help you and adjust as needed.</p>
      <h2>attendance</h2>
      <p>There is no specific attendance grade for this class, it is tied together with your engagement grade outlined below. However, if you miss four or more classes you will automatically fail the class unless you have communicated with me prior to the fourth absence.</p>
      <h2>engagement</h2>
      <p>This course has an engagement policy. Your engagement will affect your final grade (and, by extension, the quality of your work). You are expected to actively and passionately take part in this course in the following ways.</p>
      <ul class="arrow">  
        <li>Attend class meetings</li>
        <li>Create things and be prepared to show them on time.</li>
        <li>Make things thoughtfully, intentionally, and with intensity.</li>
        <li>Meet all deadlines for handing in work and process.</li>
        <li>Actively participate in critiques both in class and out of class.</li>
        <li>Be curious about making things and the things your classmates make.</li>
        <li>Care about yourself & your work, your classmates & their work, and this class.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>grading</h2>
      <p>Grades will be based on your homework (20%), engagement (20%) and projects (60%).If you do not document your work and include it in the final publication you will not pass the class.</p>
      <h3>homework (20%)</h3>
      <p>Each homework will be graded using a simple rubric you can find in the pdf syllabus on Blackboard. If you complete the assignment with care and turn it in on time, this will be an easy 20%.</p>
      <h3>engagement (20%)</h3>
      <p>This percentage will be based on your engagement in the class. Be engaged in this course and its content and this should be an easy 20%.</p>
      <h3>projects (60%)</h3>
      <p>There are two projects during the semester and each one will account for 30% of your grade. You can find the project grading rubric in the pdf syllabus on Blackboard.</p>
      <h2>late work</h2>
      <p>Late work will be accepted for two weeks after a deadline with the exception of the final project and documentation for the publication which will be due on the dates in the schedule. There is a section on the rubrics showing how late work is factored into the assignment grade.</p>
      <h2>rubrics</h2>
      <p>Rubrics are used to grade projects and homeworks. The rubrics are in the pdf syllabus on Blackboard and tied to each submission on Blackboard. The rubrics are here to allow you to understand how work is graded and to reference while working to self-evaluate. </p>

      <h2>weekly schedule</h2>
      <p>Class is on Thursdays from 4:30–7:10. Most days we will meet for the entire time but some weeks we will have individual meetings or end early. Some classes will be workshops and some classes will be taken up primarily be Visual Voices. Some classes will be work days so make sure to bring things to work on each class. Unless otherwise specified, all work is due at the beginning of class.</p>
      <p>A note—Time management is an important skill to master and should be worked on all your classes. Staying up all night working is not a badge of honor, it typically means you didn’t budget your time correctly. Staying up all night isn’t healthy and making sure you are keeping yourself healthy is your first priority.</p>
      <h2>open studio</h2>
      <p>The design faculty will be hosting open studio hours in room 1023. When the open studio is open, you will have access to computers, a space to work, or get feedback and help from the faculty member in the room. The schedule will be posted on the door of 1023 and online at art.gmu.edu/open-studio</p>
      <h2>visual voices</h2>
      <p>Voices is a year-long series of lectures by artists, art historians and others about contemporary art and art practice. Visual Voices lectures are held on four Thursday evenings from 4:45 pm – 6:30 pm.</p>

      <h2>covid protocols and face coverings</h2>
      <p>Face coverings are OPTIONAL, with some exceptions:</p>
      <ul class="arrow">
        <li>In health care facilities or designated waiting spaces for health care patients (for example, Student Health Services, COVID testing sites, Intercollegiate Athletics training and medical facilities, Peterson Population Health Center)</li>
        <li>Students in quarantine and isolation as instructed by Student Health Services</li>
        <li>For more information, go <a href="https://www.gmu.edu/safe-return-campus/personal-and-public-health/face-coverings">here</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>official communications via mason e-mail</h2>
      <p>Students are responsible for the content of university communications sent to their George Mason University e-mail account and are required to activate their account and check it regularly. All communication from the university, college, school, and program will be sent to students solely through their Mason e-mail account.</p>
      <h2>honor code</h2>
      <p>To promote a stronger sense of mutual responsibility, respect, trust, and fairness among all members of the George Mason University Community and with the desire for greater academic and personal achievement, we, the student members of the university community, have set forth this Honor Code: Student Members of the George Mason University community pledge not to cheat, plagiarize, steal, or lie in matters related to academic work. <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">Link</a>.</p>
      <h2>attendance policies</h2>
      <p>Students are expected to attend the class periods of the courses for which they register. In-class (including sections that meet online) participation is important not only to the individual student, but also to the class as a whole. Because class participation may be a factor in grading, instructors may use absence, tardiness, or early departure as de facto evidence of non-participation. Students who miss an exam with an acceptable excuse may be penalized according to the individual instructor’s grading policy, as stated in the course syllabus.</p>
      <h2>responsible employee disclosure</h2>
      <p>As a faculty member, I am designated as a “Responsible Employee,” and must report all disclosures of sexual assault, interpersonal violence, and stalking to Mason’s Title IX Coordinator per University Policy 1202. If you wish to speak with someone confidentially, please contact one of Mason’s confidential resources, such as Student Support and Advocacy Center (SSAC) at 703-380-1434 or Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 703-993-2380. You may also seek assistance from Mason’s Title IX Coordinator by calling 703-993-8730, or emailing titleix@gmu.edu</p>
      <h2>important dates</h2>
      <p>Once the add and drop deadlines have passed, instructors do not have the authority to approve requests from students to add or drop/withdraw late. Requests for late adds (up until the last day of classes) must be made by the student in the School of Art office (or the office of the department offering the course), and generally are only approved in the case of a documented university error (such as a problem with financial aid being processed), LATE ADD fee will apply. Requests for non-selective withdrawals and retroactive adds (adds after the last day of classes) must be approved by the academic dean of the college in which the student’s major is located. For AVT majors, that is the CVPA Office of Academic Affairs in College Hall.</p>

      <h2>commitment to diversity</h2>
      <p>This class will be conducted as an intentionally inclusive community that celebrates diversity and welcomes the participation in the life of the university of faculty, staff and students who reflect the diversity of our plural society. All may feel free to speak and to be heard without fear that the content of the opinions they express will bias the evaluation of their academic performance or hinder their opportunities for participation in class activities. In turn, all are expected to be respectful of each other without regard to race, class, linguistic background, religion, political beliefs, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, age, veteran’s status, or physical ability.</p>
      <h2>student support and advocacy center</h2>
      <p>The Student Support and Advocacy Center assists students who are encountering a life crisis or significant barriers that impact their academic and personal success and/or overall functioning. Our goal through individual consultations is to best understand the student’s situation, answer questions, provide guidance, and make connections to appropriate on and off-campus resources. For more information, please visit this <a href="https://ssac.gmu.edu/">website</a>.</p>
      <h2>students with disabilities and learning differences</h2>
      <p>Students with disabilities who seek accommodations in a course must be registered with the George Mason University Office of Disability Services (ODS) and inform their instructor, in writing, at the beginning of the semester. <a href="http://ods.gmu.edu">Link</a></p>

      <h2>counseling & psychological services (caps)</h2>
      <p>CAPS provides a wide range of free services to students. CAPS offers crisis, counseling, and psychiatric services virtually, and limited services in person. Services are provided by a staff of licensed clinical psychologists, licensed professional counselors, licensed social workers, doctoral-level trainees, and a board-certified psychiatrist. Our individual and group counseling, workshops, and community education programs are designed to enhance students’ personal experience and academic performance. For distance learners, please see our Resources for Distance Learning page. We also provide consultation to faculty and staff who have concerns about a student.</p>
      <p>CAPS provides short-term mental health services for enrolled students. When a student’s needs require a different level of care, CAPS works with students to transition care to community providers. If a student is currently seeing a professional in the community for therapy and can continue to work with them, we encourage the student to continue care with their current provider.</p>
      <p>To begin services with CAPS, please call us at 703-993-2380 during our business hours. Due to the rise in COVID cases, we are only offering services via telehealth during this time.</p>

      <p>If you are interested in connecting with a provider in the community for long term counseling, please visit our Find a Community Provider page for our database of community provider options and other options for connecting with a therapist. If you have student health insurance through Aetna, you may also choose to access services through TelaDoc.</p>
      <h2>anti-racist statement</h2>
      <p>The School of Art plays an integral role in building an educational environment that is committed to anti-racism and inclusive excellence. An anti-racist approach to higher education acknowledges the ways that individual, interpersonal, institutional, and structural manifestations of racism against Black, Indigenous, and other people of color contribute to inequality and injustice in our classrooms, on our campuses, and in our communities. It strives to provide our community members with resources to interrupt cycles of racism so as to cultivate a more equitable, inclusive, and just environment for all of our students, staff, faculty, alumni, and friends, regardless of racial background. An anti-racism approach is an active and ongoing, long-term process. In all our efforts, we uphold a commitment to creating honest, respectful, supportive, and healing spaces where members of our community can meaningfully dialogue and learn from each other’s lived experiences for the betterment of our entire community.</p>
      <h2>land acknowledgement</h2>
      <p>At the place George Mason University occupies, we give greetings and thanksgivings to these Potomac River life sources, the Doeg ancestors, who Virginia annihilated in violent campaigns while ripping their lands apart with the brutal system of African American enslavement, to the recognized Virginia tribes who have lovingly stewarded these lands for millennia including the Rappahannock, Pamunkey, Upper Mattaponi, Chickahominy, Eastern Chickahominy, Nansemond, Monacan, Mattaponi, Patawomeck, and Nottaway, past, present, and future, and to the Piscataway tribes, who have lived on both sides of the river from time immemorial.</p>

      <p>Inspired by mass actions and worldwide protests demanding racial justice, CVPA’s Arts in Context continues the Kritikos Anti-Racist Reading Group this semester, moderated by Mason faculty members Jessica Kallista and Kristin Johnsen-Neshati, with help from co-organizers, Cynthia Fuchs, Jordan McRae, and Sang Nam.</p>
      <p>Members of the community are called to meet in Spring 2024 for a 90-minute session once a week with a goal of long-term commitment to relationship building, awareness, reimagining, transformation, and action, around anti-racist practices, racial justice, and the creation of conversations as well as systems of compassion and healing. We continue to focus on anti-Black racism and its effects on society. </p>
      <p>Grounded in the knowledge that it is not a question of whether we are racist, but rather, how racism is expressed and experienced in ourselves, our lives, our behaviors, and our institutions, we explore books, music, art, essays, podcasts, and documentaries that allow us to critically question and consider our roles as artists, thinkers, citizens, and creatives in a society founded on racist values and practices.</p>
      <p>A schedule of sessions will be available <a href="https://cvpa.gmu.edu/events/arts-context/kritikos-anti-racist-reading-group">here</a>.</p>
